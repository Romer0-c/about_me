# About Me 

This site is built to convey my personal brand and used as a way to see a brief history of my development experience.

# Basic layout

This page will be built in a one page structure with links to other items that display my work. 
Links are listed at the bottom of the pagge 

[ADD LINKS HERE TOO](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)

# HTML Modification

the colors are ment to be dark monochromatic 
the hyperlinks to other projects should be very colorful and will glow when hovered over. 


[idk add another link here or something](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_accessibility.asp)

Its important to recognize the ability to project manage the building of the site too. 
dev work isnt only about the way the site is built but also understanding the project timeline associated with a site. 
ALTHOUGH I DONT HAVE A LOT OF PROJECTS - MAKE SURE TO HIGHLIGHT SKILLS THAT SHOW DEDICATION TO LEARNING AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. 

sleak desgin with only a few colors to help highlight the projects section as the main focal point. 
Draw the visitor to the projects section.
